                        <h2>Project Description</h2>
                        <p>Cersanit is one of the largest manufacturers of ceramic tiles and porcelain stoneware, as
                            well as sanitary ceramics. Customers have been buying products manufactured under the
                            Cersanit brand since 2002.</p>
                        <p>The products are manufactured at three modern, technologically advanced plants located in the
                            Moscow Region and the Samara Region. Over 1600 employees work at these automated and
                            environmentally friendly facilities.</p>
                        <p>After "SalesForce" left the Russian market, the company "Cersanit" faced the task of
                            preserving its data and transferring its workflow to domestic secure software within the
                            shortest possible timeframe. Deep integration of the previously used software with all the
                            company's analytical services made it impractical to rebuild the system from scratch.
                            Therefore, the option of 'creating everything from scratch' was not considered.</p>
